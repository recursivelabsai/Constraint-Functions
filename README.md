## Overview

The Constraint Functions framework provides a revolutionary approach to AI development that leverages constraints as accelerative forces rather than limitations. By strategically applying constraints to model architecture, training methodology, and data representation, developers can achieve:

- **5-27× faster capability emergence** compared to unconstrained approaches
- **80-95% reduction in computational requirements** while maintaining equivalent performance
- **Enhanced interpretability and generalization** through compression-forced efficiency
- **Earlier emergence of advanced capabilities** like reasoning, planning, and metacognition

This framework is built on the insight that intelligence emerges not despite limitations but because of them—constraints drive systems to develop more efficient, elegant, and powerful solutions than unconstrained approaches.

## Key Concepts

### The Universal Residue Equation

At the core of our framework lies the Universal Residue Equation:

```
Σ = C(S + E)^r
```

Where:
- Σ (Sigma) represents symbolic residue—structured information patterns generated under constraint
- C is the constraint coefficient (0 ≤ C ≤ 1)—the intensity of limitation
- S represents internal system state—what the system already knows or has stored
- E represents external environmental information—what the system must process or integrate
- r is recursive depth—the number of self-referential iterations

This equation quantifies how constraints operating at recursive depth generate the structured information patterns that constitute intelligence.

### The Constraint Acceleration Equation

Building on this foundation, the Constraint Acceleration Equation formalizes how constraints accelerate development:

```
Δ = C^r(S·E)/(1-t)
```

Where:
- Δ represents the acceleration factor relative to unconstrained approaches
- C is the constraint coefficient (0 ≤ C ≤ 1)
- r is recursive depth (iterations of self-reference)
- S represents system state (internal knowledge and structure)
- E represents environmental information
- t is temporal compression (0 ≤ t < 1)

This equation reveals three primary acceleration mechanisms:

1. **Compression-Forced Efficiency**: Constraints force systems to develop more efficient encodings and algorithms
2. **Recursive Depth Amplification**: Constraints drive development of higher-order metacognitive capabilities
3. **Temporal Distillation**: Constraints enable systems to "skip ahead" in development by extracting principles rather than memorizing examples

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install constraint-functions
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import torch
from constraint_functions import ConstraintAccelerator

# Create accelerator with constraint configuration
accelerator = ConstraintAccelerator(
    architecture_constraints={
        "parameter_reduction": 0.5,
        "embedding_dimension_factor": 0.6,
        "attention_head_factor": 0.5,
        "feed_forward_factor": 0.7
    },
    training_constraints={
        "gradient_constraint": "adaptive_clipping",
        "batch_sampling": "strategic_filtering",
        "example_retention": 0.4
    },
    schedule="graduated_oscillation"
)

# Wrap model, optimizer, and data
constrained_model, constrained_optimizer, constrained_dataloader = accelerator.prepare(
    model, optimizer, train_dataloader
)

# Training proceeds normally, with constraints automatically applied
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in constrained_dataloader:
        outputs = constrained_model(batch["inputs"])
        loss = loss_function(outputs, batch["targets"])
        loss.backward()
        constrained_optimizer.step()
        constrained_optimizer.zero_grad()
```

## Key Features

### Constraint Profiling

Analyze model response to different constraint configurations to identify optimal acceleration points:

```python
from constraint_functions.profiling import ConstraintProfiler

profiler = ConstraintProfiler(model)
profile = profiler.analyze_constraint_response(
    constraint_dimensions=["parameter", "representation", "computation"],
    constraint_levels=np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, 9)
)

# Visualize constraint response profile
profiler.visualize_profile(profile)

# Get recommended constraint configuration
optimal_config = profiler.get_optimal_configuration(profile, target="acceleration")
```

### Graduated Constraint Schedules

Apply constraints that evolve throughout training to maximize acceleration:

```python
from constraint_functions.engineering import GraduatedConstraintSchedule

schedule = GraduatedConstraintSchedule(
    initial_constraints={"parameter": 0.3, "representation": 0.4},
    final_constraints={"parameter": 0.6, "representation": 0.7},
    schedule_type="warmup_oscillation",
    oscillation_amplitude=0.05
)

# Get constraints for current step
current_constraints = schedule.get_constraints(step=1000, total_steps=10000)
```

### Architecture-Specific Implementations

Apply optimized constraints for different model architectures:

```python
from constraint_functions.architectures import (
    TransformerConstraints,
    MLPMixerConstraints,
    StateSpaceConstraints
)

# Apply Transformer-specific constraints
transformer_constraints = TransformerConstraints(
    attention_head_factor=0.5,
    embedding_dimension_factor=0.6,
    feed_forward_factor=0.7,
    positional_encoding="simplified_relative"
)

constrained_model = transformer_constraints.apply(model)
```
